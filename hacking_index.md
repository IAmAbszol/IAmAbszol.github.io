## [Exploring Possibility of RuneScape AI](./hacking_runescape.md)

I explore the possibility of a RuneScape AI using the RuneLite client that allows extraction of particular data that could, in theory, be used to build a Reinforcement Learning environment to train an actor. The potential to do something as such would add to the increasing difficulty Jagex faces with keeping bots out of their online games. Exploration of the RuneScape and extraction of its feature space will be the scope of this post, anything further will be performed offline while an online solution is worked on to counteract any positive results found.
